* [front-end, deployed:](http://lab-27-401.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/)

Note that the amazon deployment is not working correctly because paths to the js are incorrect. I have tried deploying twice with the same results.

### Modules
#### `counter.js`
##### Exported Values and Methods

###### `render() -> React.Fragment`
render returns a section that includes links to add or subtract from the counter, and a span class that contains the counter itself, which is a react state object. 

###### `handleUp `
an event handler that takes a click event and increments the counter.

###### `handleDown `
an event handler that takes a click event and decrements the counter.
